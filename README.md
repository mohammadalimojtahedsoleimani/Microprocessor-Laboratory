# Microprocessor-Laboratory
Welcome to the Microprocessor Laboratory repository! This project showcases our development of the classic T-REX game using an Arduino UNO board and Proteus software. The game, inspired by the well-known Google Chrome offline dinosaur game, demonstrates our proficiency in microcontroller programming, hardware interfacing, and simulation.
